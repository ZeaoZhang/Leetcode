# Special Positions in a Binary Matrix


Brute force cracking, traversing every position and checking whether the position with a value of one meets the requirements, that is, there is only one number with a value of one in the current row and column, if so, counting.

Complexity analysis:
- time complexity: O(m*n*(m + n)),  M is the number of rows in the matrix, and n is the number of columns in the matrix. The actual complexity is much less than this.

- space complexity: O(1)
