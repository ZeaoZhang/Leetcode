# Reconstructe sequence

According to the meaning of the question, if we can use all sequences[i] to construct a unique sequence, and the sequence is the same as nums, then return true, otherwise return false.

Taking each sequences as a constraint on the context of the points contained in sequences, we can transform the problem into a topological ordering problem.

First use all sequences to construct a new graph, which can be stored in a double vector array, At the same time, count the in-degree of each point.

Then run the topological sorting on the new graph, construct the corresponding topological sequence, and compare it with nums.

In terms of implementation, since the order of output points is the topological order in the topological sorting process, we don't need to save the whole topological order completely, just use a variable k to record the subscript of the current topological order, and compare the output point with nums[k]

In the process of topological order, if the output is not equal to nums[k] (the constructed scheme is different from nums) or more than 1 elements in the queue are found in a certain expansion process , the possible reasons are: 

- there is more than one point with an initial in-degree of 0, or some points are not in sequences at all
- there is more than one point with an in-degree of 0 in a single expansion, that is, the topological order is not unique

then it directly returns false,

Comparing the last element with the last element of nums, if equal, return true, else, return 0

Complexity analysis:
- time complexity: O(m), m are  the total number of elements of the sequences

- space complexity: O(n), n are  the number of elements of the nums
