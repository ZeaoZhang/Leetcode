# Group the People Given the Group Size They Belong To


We can use "hash table" to put together subscripts of the same size in the group. 
Suppose there are m elements with a group size of k, and then we can divide these m elements into groups of k.

Complexity analysis:
- time complexity: O(n), n is  the number of people

- space complexity: O(n)
