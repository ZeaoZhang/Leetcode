# Trim a Binary Search Tree


Recursion, consider 3 cases:
1. if the value of the parent node is greater than high, neither the right child node nor the parent node is needed, and the legitimate left child node is directly returned.
2. If the value of the parent node is less than low, neither the left child node nor the parent node is needed, and the legitimate right child node is directly returned.
3. If the value of the parent node is in [low,high], the left and right child nodes are legal left and right child nodes respectively.

Complexity analysis:
- time complexity: O(n),  n is the total number of nodes in the tree.

- space complexity: O(n)
