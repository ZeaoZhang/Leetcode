# Distance Between Bus Stops

First, make sure that the coding sequence of start and destination is from small to large, let s = min(start, distination), d = max(start, distination)

Go between the two to reach either clockwise or counterclockwise

Just compare the smaller cost of the two

Complexity analysis:
- time complexity: O(n), n are  the size of distance

- space complexity: O(1)
