# Design Circular Queue

Consider a vector array as a circular queue, and set two pointers, front and back. 

The difficulty of this problem lies in how to judge whether the queue is empty or full
set a flag tag with an initial value of false. When enqueuing, if the result leads to front == back, make flag = true, and when dequeuing, make flag=false.

Others are routine operations.
