# Count Unique Characters of All Substrings of a Given String


For each character I, find the same character J forward and the same character K backward. The contribution of current characters to the final result is: (i-j)*(k-i).

The position of this letter is i, mark the last position of this letter as j, the next occurrence position of this letter is marked as k. It can be known that s[j+1...i-1] and s[i+1...k-1] do not contain the character s[i], so s[i] contributes to these two parts i-j and k-i, respectively. Combine the above two parts, and the contribution of s[i] to s[j+1...k-1] is (i-j)*(k-i).

Define that the left[i] record is the position of the first identical element on the left side of s[i] and the right[i] record is the position of the first identical element on the right side of s[i]

Finally return the sum of (i-j)*(k-i)

Complexity analysis:
- time complexity: O(n),  n is the length of s.

- space complexity: O(n)
