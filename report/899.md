# Orderly Queue

When K == 1, each element can only be moved circularly, and the relative position cannot be changed. Therefore, it is only necessary to obtain the sequence with the smallest dictionary order in the process of circular movement. 
When K > 1, any sequence of the current string can be generated. Therefore, the original string is sorted to generate the sequence with the smallest dictionary order.

Complexity analysis:
- time complexity: O(n^2^), n is  the length of s

- space complexity: O(n)
