# Exclusive Time of Function

According to the question, I first thought a stack can save the information of a "Fouction".

Considering that functions can call other functions, Design a structure with four attributes, that store the id, flag(start:false, end:true), time(start time or end time), and occupytime(The running time of the calling function) respectively.

Traverse the logs array

First use the split function to get the node:

if node.flag == false, that is a start log, then push the node 

if node.flag == true, that is a end log, then pop and get the top node of the stack, that must be a start log, we can get the running time of the function and save the time.

if the stack is not empty, we let the top node.occupytime == running time 

Complexity analysis:
- time complexity: O(n * L), n is  the number of elements in logs, L is the length of the longest log in logs

- space complexity: O(n), use a stack
