# K-Similar Strings


First find the misplaced letters in A and B and exchange them.
Then dfs finds the remaining minimum number of exchanges. The general process is as follows:
There is an index that keeps moving to the right from 0. At a certain position (assuming from), if the characters of A and B in this position are equal, the index will continue to move to the right. Otherwise, a character that meets the following two requirements will be found later in A: First, this character is equal to B[from], and this character is not in the correct position (meaning that the character in A is different in the same position in B, indicating that Moreover, there may be many characters that meet the above requirements. Finally, the minimum exchange times of these schemes can be obtained.

Complexity analysis:
- time complexity: O(n), n is  the length of string s1

- space complexity: O(n)
