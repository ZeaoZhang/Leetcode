# Solve the Equation

Counting the coefficient of 'x' and constant value 
The difficulty of the question lies in discussing the left and right sides of the equal sign separately, so that flag=true, and when traversing to the equal sign, flag=false, and then all symbols are changed.

Upon completion of traversal, if 0x=0 return "Infinite solutions", if 0x=n (n!=0)ï¼Œ return "No solution"

Complexity analysis:
- time complexity: O(n), n is  the length of equation

- space complexity: O(1)
