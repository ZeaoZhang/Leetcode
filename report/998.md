# Maximun Binary Tree II

According to the question, add a node with val to the root of the maximum tree. If val is greater than the value of root, then take root as the left child of the node with val, otherwise, insert val into the corresponding position of the right child.

Complexity analysis:
- time complexity: O(n),  n is the depth of the tree.

- space complexity: O(n)
