Use vectors to represent p1p2, p1p3, p1p4, p2p3, p2p4, p3p4 respectively

Traverse all cases:
If the diagonal point is p1 p2, it is judged whether the lengths of p1p3, p1p4, p2p3, p2p4 are equal and whether the inner product of p1p3 and p1p4 is 0. If both are true, it returns true.
Similarly, the diagonal points are p1, p3 and p1, p4, respectively.
And finally returns false.

Complexity analysis:
- time complexity: O(1)

- space complexity: O(1)
