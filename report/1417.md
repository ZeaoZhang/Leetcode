# Reformat The String

easy question
Separate the numbers and letters directly, and then merge by two pointers. 
If the difference between the two numbers exceeds 1, then an empty string is returned. 
else put the string with more characters first, and check whether it is out of range in the middle of while loop.

Complexity analysis:
- time complexity: O(n), n is  the length of s

- space complexity: O(1)
