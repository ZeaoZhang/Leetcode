# Maximum Swap


First, convert num to string sï¼Œ sort s in reverse order. Compare the string s before and after sorting, and find out the first one that is different. 
These two are the numbers to be exchanged, and then, from the one before sorting to the back, find out the same number as the sorted one, and exchange the two char.
convert s to num, return 

Complexity analysis:
- time complexity: O(nlogn),  n is the size of nums.

- space complexity: O(1)
