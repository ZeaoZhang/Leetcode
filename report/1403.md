# Minimum Subsequence in Non-Increasing Order

First sort the array, then traverse the array sum, finally sum it in reverse order, and add it to the returned array result. 

When ans is greater than sum/2, exit the loop and return the result array.


Complexity analysis:
- time complexity: O(nlogn), n is  the size of nums

- space complexity: O(1)
