# Print Binary Tree

First, we can get the height of the tree and let depth equals it, define vector<vector<string>> res(depth + 1, vector<string>(pow(2, depth + 1) - 1, "")) and save the first node enqueue and its position 

We can use queue q for Level traverse and use queue position to save the position of every element

During the traverse, save the values of nodes to res in turn, save the new node to queue q and save the position of the node to queue position in order to the next traversel

finally return res

Complexity analysis:
- time complexity: O(n),  n is the total number of nodes in the tree.

- space complexity: O(n)
