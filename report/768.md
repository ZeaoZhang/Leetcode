# Max Chunks To Make Sorted II

Use a arrays of length n.

minarr[i] represents the minimum value of arr[i]~arr[n-1]
The maximum value of arr[0] ~ arr[i] can be compared with the new element every time.
Then, for every I of 1~(n -1), as long as left Max <= right Min then it can be cut off between I-1 and I.

Complexity O(N)Complexity analysis:
- time complexity: O(n), n is  the number of elements in arr

- space complexity: O(n)
