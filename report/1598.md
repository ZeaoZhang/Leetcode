# Crawler Log Folder

According to the meaning of the question, the operation of returning to the home folder is to continuously return to the previous directory until returning to the home directory, and the operands used in this operation are the least. We use a variable to record the hierarchy of the current directory of ans, and ans is initialized to 0. According to the meaning of the question:

If the current operation is "../":move to the parent folder of the current folder. If it is already under the home folder, stay in the current folder. At this time, if the hierarchy ans>0, the ans will be reduced by 1, otherwise, the ans will remain unchanged;

If the current operation is "./":stay in the current folder, and the ans will remain unchanged;

If the current operation is "x/": move to a subfolder named x on the next level. At this time, ans is increased by 1.

Finally, return ans.


Complexity analysis:
- time complexity: O(n),  n is the size of logs

- space complexity: O(1)
