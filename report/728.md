# Trandform to Chessboard

According to the question, because only rows and columns can be changed, there are only two kinds of all rows on the chessboard, and these two kinds are completely opposite, that is to say, only one row can be calculated. The same is true for columns, so the chessboard can be simplified as one row and one column, and only one row and one column can be operated. 

First, we check the chessboard, if there are more than two pairs of opposite arrangements on the chessboard, or the black-and-white gap in a single row is greater than 1, there is no solution.

Next, we calculate the the number of moves of a row and a column to get a right chessboard, and return their sum.

Complexity analysis:
- time complexity: O(n^2^),  n is the number of elements of a row in chessboard

- space complexity: O(n)
