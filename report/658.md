# Find K Closest Elements

According to the question, arr is an ordered array, the k closest values must be connected together
Traverse the array with the pointer i, if x - arr[i] <= arr[i + k] - x, that we find the k closest integers, then exit cycle

return vector<int>(arr.begin() + i, arr.begin() +i + k)

Complexity analysis:
- time complexity: O(n),  n is the number of elements of arr

- space complexity: O(1)
