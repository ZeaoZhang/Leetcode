# Check If a Word Occurs As a Prefix of Any Word in a Sentence


Initialize the variable i= 0, indicating the current traversed position, making j = 1, indicating which word is currently traversed, and making len = searchWord.size()
Traverse sentence in turn:
- if the string with length len from i is equal to searchWord, exit the loop, otherwise i points to the next word in sentence and ++j.judge 
- if i + len is out of range, exit the loop
Finally return to J.

Complexity analysis:
- time complexity: O(n),  n is the size of the sentence.

- space complexity: O(1)
