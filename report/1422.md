# Maximum Score After Splitting a String

First count the total number of 1, and traverse from left to right. Each' 0' will increase the score by 1 point, and each' 1' will decrease the score by 1 point (because each occurrence of a' 1' means that the score of the original right string is 1 less). 
Since the substring cannot be an empty string, it should be judged separately that the result at the beginning of the string is the initial value, and the traversal cannot reach the end (because the end means that the right substring is 0).

Complexity analysis:
- time complexity: O(n), n is  the length of s

- space complexity: O(1)
