# Search Duplicate Subtrees


In the form of binary tree serialization,establish a hash table, and the number of occurrences of sequence is counted. If the number of occurrences is two, the root node is added to the result set.


Complexity analysis:
- time complexity: O(n^2^), n is the number of nodes in the tree. 

- space complexity: O(n^2^)
