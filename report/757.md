# Set Intersection Size At Least Two

First, sort all the intervals from small to large according to the right endpoint and from large to small according to the left endpoint. 

let ans = 0, which record the result

When comparing whether interval s intersects with interval [a, b], we only need to maintain the two largest numbers pre and P in interval s.

For each interval [a, b], Comparing its left endpoint with pre, p:
if a > p, ans += 2, let p = b, pre = b- 1
if a > pre and a < p, ans += 1, let pre = p, p = b


Complexity analysis:
- time complexity: O(nlogn), n are  the number of elements of the array
- space complexity: O(1)
