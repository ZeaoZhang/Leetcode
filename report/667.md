# Beautiful Arrangement II


This problem is to find rules.
when n = 10， k = 5：
[1, 6, 2, 5, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9]
when n = 20，k = 13：
[1, 14, 2, 13, 3, 12, 4 ,11, 5, 10, 6, 9, 7, 8, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]
the rule is:
For [0, k], even subscripts are filled with [1,2,3…], odd subscripts are filled with [k+1, k, k-1…], and the following [k+1, k + 2, n-1] are all sequentially filled.
Next, solve it with loop.

Complexity analysis:
- time complexity: O(n)

- space complexity: O(1)
