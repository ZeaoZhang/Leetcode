If all operations are performed even times, they will be cancelled out, so there are only two kinds of operations: 0 and 1, that is, no effect and effective;
And each one operation 2 and 3 is equivalent to one operation 1;
Draw a similar truth table, you can deduce that when n>=3 and m>=3, the result will only be 8;
Next, consider individual cases.

Complexity O(N)Complexity analysis:
- time complexity: O(1)

- space complexity: O(1)
