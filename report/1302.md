# Deepest Leaves Sum

The question can be implemented using depth-first search. Traverse the whole binary tree from root. When traversing a node, you need to record the number of layers of the node, and specify that the root node is at the 0th layer. Maintain the sum of the maximum number of layers and the deepest nodes during traversal.

For each non-empty node, judge the relationship between the number of layers of the current node and the maximum number of layers:

- If the number of layers of the current node is greater than the maximum number of layers, the nodes traversed before are not the deepest nodes, so the maximum number of layers is updated with the number of layers of the current node, and the sum of the deepest nodes is updated to the current node value;

- If the number of layers of the current node is equal to the maximum number of layers, the current node value is added to the sum of the deepest nodes.

Continue depth-first search on the left and right child nodes of the current node.

After the traversal, the sum of leaf nodes with the deepest layers can be obtained.

Complexity analysis:
- time complexity: O(n), n is  the total number of nodes in the tree

- space complexity: O(n)
