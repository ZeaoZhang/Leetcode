# Preimage Size of Factorial Zeros Function

In the decimal system, only 2 and 5 are multiplied to get 10, that is, for every pair of 2 and 5, there is one more 0 at the end.

And factorial is multiplied from 1 to x, so the number of 2 is always more than 5, then the problem is transformed into finding x! How many 5 are there as factors?

The formula is k = x/5+x/5^2+x/5^3+x/5 3+ ......

According to the above formula:
x/5+x/5 2+x/5 3+... = k => x/5 <= k <=10^9 = > x <= 5 * k
It's easy to think of binary solution of x in [0, 5*k + 1]

Obviously, x + 5 once, the factorial will be multiplied by at least one more 5, and there will be at least one more 0 at the end, so if the above x has a solution, it will be 5, and if there is no solution, it will be 0.

That is, if we can find a solution by binary search, we will return 5, otherwise we will return 0.

Complexity analysis:
- time complexity: O(log(k))

- space complexity: O(1)
