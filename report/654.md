# Maximum Binary Tree

We can use a recursive funtion createTree(nums, i, j) to express the selection of element from nums[i] to nums[j] to create a tree.

First, we can use getmaxpos function to find the maximum from nums[i] to nums[j] as the value of root
Next, we start recursive process

- The left subtree is createTree(nums, i, pos - 1)
- The right subtree is createTree(nums, pos + 1, j)

when i > j, return nullptr

Complexity analysis:
- time complexity: O(n^2^), n is  the number of elements in nums.

- space complexity: O(n)
