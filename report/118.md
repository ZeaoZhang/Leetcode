# Pascal's Triangle

The first layer of loop starts with subscript 1, that is, add the elements of the first array
The second layer of loop processes the value of arr[i], if i equals the value of both ends, assign 1 to both ends. else adds the left and right values respectively, and assigns values.


Complexity analysis:
- time complexity: O(numRows^2^), numRows is the the numbers of rows of Pascal's triangle.

- space complexity: O(1), The return value is not included in the space complexity
