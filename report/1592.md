# Rearrange Spaces Between Words


First, record the number of words and spaces, calculate the number of spaces between every two words and the number of spaces at the end, and finally save it in the new string and return it.


Complexity analysis:
- time complexity: O(n),  n is the length of text.

- space complexity: O(1)
