# Binary Tree Purning

Create a function that determines whether the subtree has a node with a value of one
Order traversal is performed on the sub-tree, using the function once for each node in turn

Complexity analysis:
- time complexity: O(m * n), m, n are respectively the number of nodes of the tree and the number of layers of the tree
- space complexity: O(k), k is the most number of nodes of one layer in the tree
