# Validate Stack Sequences

We consider using stack to solve this problem.
Considering the default container of stack is deque, and the underlying structure is complex. So we can use vector rather stack. Here, we only need to simulate the stack operation, and vector can do it.

First, traverse the array pushed and stack each element of pushed in turn;

Every time a pushed element is put into the stack, if the stack is not empty and the top element is the same as the current element of the popped, the top element of the stack is taken out of the stack, and the array popped is traversed at the same time until the stack is empty or the top element is different from the current element of the popped.

After the traverse, if the index of popped points to the end of popped, return true, else return false

Complexity analysis:
- time complexity: O(n), n is  the number of elements in pushed

- space complexity: O(n)
