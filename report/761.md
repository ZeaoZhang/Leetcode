# Special Binary String

According to the question, Special binary strings are binary strings with the following two properties:
- The number of 0's is equal to the number of 1's.
- Every prefix of the binary string has at least as many 1's as 0's.

so we can konw The leftmost part of a special string must be one, and the rightmost part must be zero. Only in this way can it satisfy the above characteristics.

- the original string can be divided into several segments of special string that can't be subdivided; 
- for every special character string that can't be subdivided, after the processing, it must be a "1" + the mid string + '0'. Here, the processing means the string with the largest dictionary order. The process is recursive and ends with a string length of 0.
-  Arrange these processed strings according to the dictionary order from largest to smallest, which is the desired string.


Complexity analysis:
- time complexity: O(n^2^), n is  the length of the strings

- space complexity: O(n)
