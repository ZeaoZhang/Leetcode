# Add One Row to Tree

According to the question, we need add a row to the binarytree, considering easily using Level Traverse to solve it.
first, if depth == 1, create a tree node with value val as the new root of the whole original tree, and the original tree is the new root's left subtree, return the new root
else during the traverse, record the number of level(num), when num == depth - 1, make the node in current queue dequeue and insert new node with value val between the node and its left child and right child
finally return the original root

Complexity analysis:
- time complexity: O(n), n is  the number of nodes in the tree

- space complexity: O(n)
