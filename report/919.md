# Complete Binary Tree Inserter

During initialization, level traverseal for the binary tree . If any subtree of the traversed node is empty, this node is added to the queue Qu

When running the insert function:
If the left subtree of the first element of the queue is empty, the newly established node is added to the left subtree and queued
Otherwise, the newly established node is added to the right subtree and queued, and the first node of the queue is out of the queue

when running the get_root function:
return root

Complexity analysis:
- time complexity: O(n), n is  the total number of nodes of the binary tree

- space complexity: O(m), m is the number of nodes that at least have an empty subtree
