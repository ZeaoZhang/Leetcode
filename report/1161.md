# Maximun Level Sum of a Binary Tree

When I see this problem, my first thought is Level traversal.

We only need to calculate the total number of nodes in the next layer when each layer is traversed, and save the number of nodes in the layer with the largest number of nodes (maxnum) and the number of layers (maxlevel), and compare them with other layers (the number of layers is level). If num > maxnum, make maxnum = num and maxlevel = level.
return maxlevel


Complexity analysis:
- time complexity: O(n), n is  the total number of nodes of the tree

- space complexity: O(n), At worst, there are O(n) nodes in the array.
