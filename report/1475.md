# Final Prices With a Spcial Discount in a Shop


For the price of the second item is _prices[i]_, we need to find the corresponding possible discount. 

According to the requirements of the title, we traverse backwards from the _i+1_ commodity in turn until we find the first subscript jj that satisfies _prices [j] â‰¤ prices [i]_, and then we can calculate the final discount price of this commodity. 

Complexity analysis:
- time complexity: O(n^2^), n is  the number of elements in prices.

- space complexity: O(1)
