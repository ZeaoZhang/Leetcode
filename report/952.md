# Largest Component Size by Common Factor

When I saw this question, the first way that came to my mind was create graph +BFS, the time complexity is O(n 2 logc), where C refers to every number in nums, and the time-out is mainly due to the cycle in the process of mapping.
After careful consideration, use the union set to connect the elements by the common factor between them.
Define the array father and cnt of size N, first let the root node of 1~N be itself, then traverse the array, find the factor i of the currently traversed element, and merge nodes num and i and num, Num/i. At last, the nums array is traversed, with cnt[find (num)]++ and ans = max(ans, CNT [find (num)] in each round.

Complexity analysis:
- time complexity: O(n^1.5^), n is  the number of elements of nums

- space complexity: O(1), N is a constant
