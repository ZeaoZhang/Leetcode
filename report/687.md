# Longest Univalue Path

For any node, if the longest path with the same value contains the node, there are only two situations:
- 1. the longer path of the same value formed by adding this node to its left and right subtrees continues to trace back to the parent node to form the longest path of the same value.
- 2. The left and right subtrees plus this node are all in the longest path with the same value, which constitutes the final longest path with the same value.
Because the same value is required, the value of the current node should be added as the judgment basis when judging the path with the same value that the left and right subtrees can form.

Complexity O(N)Complexity analysis:
- time complexity: O(n), n is  the number of nodes in the tree

- space complexity: O(n)
