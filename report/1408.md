# String Matching in an Array

For a certain string words[i] in the string array, we only need to enumerate words[j], where j != i, if len(words[i]) >= len(words[j]), then continue. if words[i] is a substring of words[j], then test[i] will be added to the result

Complexity analysis:
- time complexity: O(n^2^ * L^2^), n is  the number of elements in words, L is the length of the longest word in words

- space complexity: O(1)
