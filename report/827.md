# Making A Large Island


Traverse the grid once, get the area of each island, and make a number record. Map can be used to record, key is the island number and value is the island area. 

Traverse the grid, traverse the squares of 0 (because it is necessary to change 0 into 1), count the island areas around this 1 (from 0 to 1), add up its adjacent areas, and traverse all 0, then you can get the maximum area after selecting a 0 to become 1.

Complexity analysis:
- time complexity: O(m * n), m , n is the length and width of the grid.

- space complexity: O(m * n)
