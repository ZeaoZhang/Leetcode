# Design Circular Deque

The circular queue is realized by array.
the empty or full of the queue is judged by tag. 
When front == rear, if tag == false, then the queue is empty, else the queue is full
When use insert function, determining whether tag is true by judging whether front == rear.
When use delete function, determining whether tag is false by judging whether front == rear.

Complexity analysis:
- time complexity: O(1)

- space complexity: O(k), k is the initalize size of the queue.
