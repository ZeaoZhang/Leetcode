# Rank Transform of an Array

First, save the elements with the key of the map container
then assign the ranking to the corresponding value in turn
finally traverse the arr and let arr[i] = mp[arr[i]]
return arr

Complexity analysis:
- time complexity: O(n), n are  the number of elements in arr

- space complexity: O(n)
