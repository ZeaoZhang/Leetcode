# Shift 2D Grid

For a 2D grid of size of m * n, we need to shift the grid k times
 
Considering after shifting m * n times, the array we get is equal with the grid. let step = k % (m * n)

For this translation of the array elements, we can consider the 2D array as a 1D array 

Create an array of the same size as grid
then let i = step, which represents the location of the starting element in the new array, namely, array[i / m][i % m]
let j = 0, which represents the location of the starting element in grid, namely, grid[j / m][j % m]

put the elements of grid into the new array successively, 
let array[i / m][i % m] = grid[j / m][j % m], then ++i, ++j
if i equals m * n, then let i = 0
until j equals m * n, end while loop


Complexity analysis:
- time complexity: O(m * n), m, n are respectively the number of rows of grid and the number of columns of grid
- space complexity: O(1), The return value is not included in the space complexity
