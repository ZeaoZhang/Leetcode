# Make Two Arrays Equal by Reversing Sub-arrays

According to the question, the positions of any two elements in the array can be exchanged by one or two flips. Once any two elements in an array can exchange positions, the array can be rearranged arbitrarily. As long as the elements in arr and target are the same, arr can become target through several operations.
So we sort target and arr, if they equals then return true, else return false

Complexity analysis:
- time complexity: O(nlogn),  n is the number of elements of arr

- space complexity: O(logn), the average recursion depth of quick sort is O(logn).
