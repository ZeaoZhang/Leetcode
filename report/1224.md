# Maximum Equal Frequency

We can use a hash table(mp) to save the number of occurrences of the number. 
During the traversal, record the maximum frequency(maxcount) the number appears and this number(maxcountvalue).
If current number > maxcount, then update maxcount and maxcountvalue

After each round of traversal:
if maxcountvalue is 1 , there is one number in mp or there is two number and the maxcount is 1, then maxpre = the current index + 1

After the traversal, return maxpre

Complexity analysis:
- time complexity: O(n), n is  the number of elements in nums.

- space complexity: O(n)
