# Maximum Width of Binary Tree

According to the question, The width of one level is defined as the length between the end-nodes (the leftmost and rightmost non-null nodes), where the null nodes between the end-nodes that would be present in a complete binary tree extending down to that level are also counted into the length calculation.

We can use level traverse and the properties of Complete Binary Tree to solve the question. According to the nature of a complete binary tree with subscript from the beginning, if a few points are listed as I below, the subscript of the left child of the tree is 2 * i, and the subscript of the right child is 2 * i + 1.

we save the node and the subscript of the current node in the complete binary tree in the auxiliary stack in level traverse

Initialize maxWidth to 1, After traversing a layer, the nodes and their subscripts of the next layer are in the stack. We can calculate the difference between the subscripts of the first node and the last node of the next layer, that is, the width of this layer. Make maxwidth save the maximum width.

return the maxWidth

Complexity analysis:
- time complexity: O(n),  n is the total number of nodes in the Binary Tree

- space complexity: O(n)
